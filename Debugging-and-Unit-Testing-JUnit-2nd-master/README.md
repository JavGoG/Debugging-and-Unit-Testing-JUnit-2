Debugging and JUnit
I wrote this code with the IDE Intellij in Java 8. This application uses the JUnit 4 API, as well as the JUnit 5 API, thanks to the jupiter package we can write annotations to make clearer our code. I followed the instructions of the teacher Tim Buchalka (Udemy, Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 and Java 17).
